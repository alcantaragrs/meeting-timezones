> Helper to find the best meeting time across multiple timezones

ðŸ”— [Meeting Timezones](http://)

The idea of this projects was to build a visual helper where the user can choose different locations and see the intersections of time intervals for each one so he can schedule the best meeting time across multiple timezones. On the technical aspect the goal was to use HTML, CSS and JS to exercise my base knowledge of web development, consume data from a free time zone API and develop the app using a TDD (Test-Driven-Development) approach also for exercise/trainning purposes.
